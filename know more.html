             <li><h3><font color="red">What is Artificial Intelligence?</font>  </h3></li>
             <i><b>Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. </b></i>
             <li><h3><font color="red">HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</font>  </h3></li>
             <i><b>Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" 
                At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.
                
                The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.  
                
                The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?
                
                In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.</b></i>
                <li><h3><font color="red">The three different types of Artificial Intelligence – ANI, AGI and ASI:</font>  </h3></li>
                <i><b><ul>
                    <li><h4><font color="purple">1)Artificial Narrow Intelligence:</font>  </h4></li>
                    <p>ANI is also referred to as Narrow AI or Weak AI. This type of artificial intelligence is one that focuses primarily on one single narrow task, with a limited range of abilities. If you think of an example of AI that exists in our lives right now, it is ANI. This is the only type out of the three that is currently around. This includes all kinds of Natural Language or Siri. </p>
                    <li><h4><font color="purple">2)Artificial General Intelligence:</font>  </h4></li>
                    <p>AGI technology would be on the level of a human mind. Due to this fact, it will probably be some time before we truly grasp AGI, as we still don’t know all there is to know about the human brain itself. However, in concept at least, AGI would be able to think on the same level as a human, much like Sonny the robot in I-Robot featuring Will Smith.</p>
                    <li><h4><font color="purple">3)Artificial Super Intelligence:</font>  </h4></li>
                    <p>This is where it gets a little theoretical and a touch scary. ASI refers to AI technology that will match and then surpass the human mind. To be classed as an ASI, the technology would have to be more capable than a human in every single way possible. Not only could these AI things carry out tasks, but they would even be capable of having emotions and relationships.</p>
